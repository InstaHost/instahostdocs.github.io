# Roadmap

This is the general roadmap for Instahost. It is mostly used to gather my thoughts and is most likely really confusing for most. I might go through and make it more in depth and clear, but for now it is mostly here for self-reference.

## General Plans

- [ ] Determine which services should be supported
- [ ] Create a standardized docker compose which will work for most services

---

## CLI Plans

- [ ] Create a command line interface in python which determines which services should used
- [ ] Create a script which generates required directorys for each chosen service
- [ ] Create a script which generates a docker compose with each chosen service
- [ ] Create a script which sets every service on a different user
- [ ] Create a script that saves the previous highest user id in case the script is used again
- [ ] Create a method which sets every user starts at 1 above the current highest ID

---

## Documentation Plans

- [ ] Create a static documentation website
- [ ] Create a list of planned supported services
- [ ] Create a list of currently supported services
- [ ] Create an individual setup guide for each service
